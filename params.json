{"name":"Openduty","tagline":"An open source Alerting and incident escalation tool","body":"#What is this?\r\n**Openduty** is an incident escalation tool, just like [Pagerduty](http://pagerduty.com) . It has a Pagerduty compatible API too. It's the result of the first [Ustream Hackathon](http://www.ustream.tv/blog/2014/03/27/hackathon-recap-21-ideas-11-teams-one-goal/). We enjoyed working on it.\r\n#Integrations\r\nHas been tested with Nagios, works well for us. Any Pagerduty Notifier using the Pagerduty API should work without a problem.\r\n#Notifications\r\nXMPP, email, SMS, Phone(Thanks Twilio for being awesome!), and Push notifications(thanks Pushover also) are supported at the moment.\r\n#Current status\r\nOpenduty is in Beta status, it can be considered stable at the moment, however major structural changes can appear anytime (not affecting the API, or the Notifier structure)\r\n\r\n#Contribution guidelines\r\nYes, please. You are welcome.\r\n#Feedback\r\nAny feedback is welcome\r\n\r\n#Contributors at Ustream\r\n- [deathowl](http://github.com/deathowl)\r\n- [oker](http://github.com/oker1)\r\n- [tyrael](http://github.com/tyrael)\r\n- [dzsubek](https://github.com/dzsubek)\r\n- [ecsy](https://github.com/ecsy)\r\n- [akos](https://github.com/gyim)\r\n\r\n![The team](http://deathowlsnest.com/images/cod.jpg)\r\n\r\n# Getting started:\r\n```\r\nsudo easy_install pip\r\nsudo pip install virtualenv\r\nvirtualenv env\r\n. env/bin/activate\r\npip install -r requirements.txt\r\nexport DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=openduty.settings_dev\r\npython manage.py syncdb\r\npython manage.py runserver\r\n```\r\nnow, you can start hacking on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Default login:\r\nroot/toor\r\n\r\n# Celery worker:\r\n```celery -A openduty worker -l info```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
